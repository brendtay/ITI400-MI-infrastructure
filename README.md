The project goal is to develop, implement, and maintain an easy-to-use website that allows users to report issues pertaining to public infrastructure.
Including Potholes, broken sidewalks, Street lights, street lights, and damaged signs

The reporting and repair process will be streamlined resulting in faster and improved public safety
This project will facilitate collaboration between users and local authorities by integrating GPS data and photo submissions, thus enhancing transparency, communication, and responsiveness to maintenance needs.

Programming Language & Tools
Languages

Frontend Development
HTML: The backbone of any web page, providing the basic structure for the user interface and web page layout. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content types.

CSS: Enables thorough customization of the visual appearance of web pages, ensuring that the interface is user-friendly and visually appealing. It allows developers to apply styles, layouts, and responsive designs to enhance user experience.

JavaScript: Adds necessary functionality to enable interactivity between the user interface and users. It supports responsive and dynamic updates, allowing for real-time interactions without requiring page reloads.

React: A powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the state effectively, enhancing performance and maintainability.

Bootstrap: A popular frontend framework for building responsive web pages quickly. It provides pre-designed templates and components, such as navigation bars, forms, buttons, and grids, making it easier to create mobile-first designs.

Vite: A modern build tool that offers a fast development experience by leveraging native ES modules. It provides features like hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid feedback during development, optimized build processes for production, and built-in support for various frontend technologies, including React.

Backend Development
Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime environment that enables asynchronous programming. It handles operations like database queries, API requests, and file uploads efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs and handling routing, middleware, and server-side logic, making backend development more efficient.

Database
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database management system that can handle complex and large datasets. It supports advanced queries and data relationships, ensuring that detailed information is readily available. With features like ACID compliance and extensive data types, PostgreSQL is ideal for applications requiring reliability and performance.
